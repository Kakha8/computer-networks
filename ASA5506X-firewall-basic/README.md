This project uses cisco ASA5506x firewall to create two networks, an inside and outside. 
The inside network is 192.168.1.0/24 and contains an L2 switch and a PC. DHCP is set up on the inside
network with the DNS server 8.8.8.8. The outside network is 209.165.200.224/30. The outside network contains a 
router and a server. The server 8.8.8.8 acts as a DNS server and a web server.
