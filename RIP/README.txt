In this project there are two networks with a single pc connected to each. These are 192.168.1.0 and 172.16.0.0. between these PCs there are 8 routers connected with a serial cable. The RIP routing protocol used to route traffic between the above-mentioned networks. It takes the path with the least hops. If one router is down it will automatically readjust and take the next shortest path.
